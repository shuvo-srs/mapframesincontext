<h2> Bay of Bengal Dreamscape </h2>
<p>This map is a trippy, playful visualization of the Bay of Bengal—made not to explain, warn, or instruct, but simply to explore how far cartography can lean into visual experience.</p>

<p>There is nothing critical being communicated here. No analysis to extract, no decision to support. The goal was curiosity and aesthetic experimentation: what happens when bathymetry is treated less like data and more like texture?</p>

<p>The layered contours exaggerate depth and movement, turning the sea floor into something almost tactile. Instead of calm gradients, the surface pulses. The Bay feels alive, restless, slightly unreal—more dreamscape than diagram.</p>

<p>This is where cartography overlaps with art. The data remains real, but its presentation steps away from neutrality. Accuracy exists beneath the surface, yet perception takes the front seat.</p>

<p>The map was inspired by experimental cartographic styles seen in creative GIS workflows, particularly the reference video used as a visual guide. The influence is intentional, but the execution remains personal—an exercise in pushing ArcGIS Pro beyond its usual “professional” look.</p>

<p>Maps do not always need to be serious to be meaningful. Sometimes they exist to surprise the eye, to bend expectations, or simply to remind us that geography can be strange, beautiful, and fun.</p>

<p>This is not a map meant to be read carefully.<br>
It is a map meant to be felt.</p>
