<h2>Dhanmondi Stitched</h2>

<p>
Stiching was the pandemic hobby of my beloved wife (then friend), Sharmin Sultana Alis. During the COVID lockdown, she would create vibrant embroidered artwork on everything from denim jackets to socks using a needle and colorful thread. It was a time when human creativity bloomed in strange and beautiful ways. People began making all sorts of things—some sang, others wrote stories. But once life returned to normal, that wave of creativity faded away as suddenly as it had arrived........

Another fascinating example of needlework was kantha stitching. When I was a child, under the supervision of my grandmother, the village women would sew kanthas from old sarees during rainy days. Some had embroidered flowers and birds, others even carried lines of poetry. They may not have been as grand as the Nakshi Kanthas that hang from top to bottom in Aarong’s six-story building, but they were no less charming. It was a different kind of creativity—quiet, communal, and soulful. It's been ages since I witnessed that kind of quilting in action.

Today’s map was inspired by those needleworks I once observed. Though in Bangladesh, the traditional season for stitching is monsoon, I thought this rainy Baishakh day would be the perfect time to try capturing Dhanmondi Lake and its surrounding area within an embroidery hoop, using John Nelson’s stitch map symbology on ArcGIS Pro.

 Time for a little geography: among the few remaining patches of green in the greyness of Dhaka, Dhanmondi Lake stands out. It’s currently 3 kilometers long, 35 to 100 meters wide, with a maximum depth of 4.77 meters, and a total waterbody area of 37.37 hectares (about 16% of Dhanmondi’s total area). The lake features a dendritic drainage pattern with some trellis patterns woven in.

While today it functions as the sole drainage outlet for the nearby area, about a century ago it was believed to be part of the long lost Karwan Bazaar River or Caravan River. It likely flowed through Begunbari Canal, Green Road, Kalabagan, Dhanmondi Lake, and eventually into the Turag River. It’s said that large sailboats once traveled this river route, bringing rice from the haor regions. The area eventually became known as Dhanmandi or Dhanmondi—from dhan (rice) and mandi (market, from Persian).

    After the river dried up in the early 20th century—technically becoming an oxbow lake—the surrounding land turned into overgrown wilderness. In the 1950s, the Ayub Khan regime acquired this land and transformed it into a residential zone for East Pakistan’s upper class.
