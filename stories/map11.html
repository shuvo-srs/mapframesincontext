<h2> A Personal Map </h2>

<p>This map shows a portion of Manikganj—my hometown—but not as an official dataset would present it. This is Manikganj as I see it, remember it, and move through it. It is a deeply personal geography, drawn from lived experience rather than administrative logic.</p>

<p>The map is built with the precision of GIS: roads align correctly, locations sit where they truly are, and distances are not imagined. Yet what gets emphasized, named, or even ignored is entirely subjective. The red X marks are my spots—places that matter to me. Some are important because of memory, some because of routine, some simply because they anchor my sense of the area.</p>

<p>There are no official boundaries here. No wards, no unions, no upazila limits. Instead, the map uses names as people actually speak them, as I speak them. These are not labels from a gazetteer; they are names that live in conversation. The map replaces administrative authority with personal familiarity.</p>

<p>The symbology follows preference rather than convention. What is large, what is small, what is named, and what is left unnamed all reflect how I prioritize space. A college, a tea stall, a junction, a road bend—each carries weight based on use and meaning, not hierarchy.</p>

<p>One critical geographic idea is visible immediately: the white space. Large portions of the map are intentionally empty. Those areas exist in reality, but they do not exist in my description of the district. They are not important for how I navigate, remember, or explain this place. In that sense, absence becomes a form of data.</p>

<p>This is the core argument of the map: the same place can produce radically different maps depending on who is mapping it. Geography is shared, but meaning is personal. Two people can stand on the same road and carry entirely different spatial stories in their heads.</p>

<p>Tools like Google My Maps or saved places in Google Maps move us toward personal mapping, but they remain constrained by platforms built for general use. There is still a large research and design space for truly personal cartography—maps that prioritize memory, preference, emotion, and lived relevance as first-class geographic variables.</p>

<p>The visual language of this map is heavily inspired by a custom ArcGIS Pro style, adapted to support this narrative approach. The aesthetic reinforces the idea that this is not an official map meant for governance, but a subjective one meant for understanding how a place exists inside a person.</p>

<p>This is not just a map of Manikganj.<br>
It is a map of my Manikganj.</p>
