<h2> Teknaf Tolkiened </h2>
<p>J.R.R. Tolkien famously said, "I wisely started with a map and made the story fit." As a lifelong fan of both Lord of the Rings and cartography, I've always been captivated by Tolkien's maps and their intricate world-building. I'm also an avid collector of old maps, finding stories and details hidden within their lines and textures.</p>

<p>Inspired by John Nelson's fantastic Tolkien-style mapmaking tutorial, I couldn't resist creating my own. Using data from OpenStreetMap, I transformed a random hilly region of Bangladesh into a map reminiscent of Middle-earth, crafted during a quick lunch break.

Teknaf, a small town in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, is often overlooked for its natural beauty and cultural significance. In this map, I've reimagined Teknaf in the style of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, where the lush forests and rivers of the region are transformed into a fantasy landscape.
