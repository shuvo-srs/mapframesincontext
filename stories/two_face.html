<h2> Two Faces of Dhaka </h2>

<p>
Dhaka first became the capital of Bengal during the reign of Mughal emperor Jahangir. Since then, different rulers and regimes have tried to shape the city in their own ways. Not all of those attempts were planned, and not all of them endured. Over time, much has been lost—some physically, some only surviving in memory. Yet many traces remain preserved in names alone. Hatirjheel no longer has elephants, Motijheel has lost its wetland, and the rice fields of Dhanmondi have transformed into dense residential neighborhoods. The once “Grand Area” is now Gandaria, stalled in rickshaw and truck traffic. Armanitola, Farashganj, and Postogola no longer carry visible signs of Armenian, French, or Portuguese presence—those histories linger mostly on paper.

Still, not everything has vanished. Certain structures and spatial logics continue to survive with quiet confidence.

This map presents two neighborhoods of Dhaka that developed in different periods of its history. Areas that emerged during the Mughal era and shortly afterward followed an Asian market-centered urban pattern. In simple terms, these neighborhoods grew around a bazaar—such as Siddique Bazar or Nazirabazar. This organic, market-driven structure is not unique to Dhaka; similar neighborhood patterns can still be found in district towns across the country. Narrow lanes, irregular plots, and dense, mixed-use development defined these areas.

Later, particularly during the Ayub Khan era, a very different approach to urban development took shape. Neighborhoods such as Mirpur, Gulshan, Banani, and, more recently, Uttara were built using a sector-based planning system. Here, urban form is controlled by sectors, roads, and zoning rather than by markets. The layout is more ordered, modern, and deliberate.

<p>
The map below places these two urban logics side by side: the organic, bazaar-centered fabric of old Dhaka and the planned, sector-based structure of modern Dhaka. Together, they remind us that Dhaka is not just a city—it is a living map, layered with time.
