<h2>Eid Echoes: A World of Distorted Devotion</h2>

<p>
What if the size of countries were determined not by land area or population, but by the number of mosques they contain? 
This Eid special cartographic experiment explores that very question.
</p>

<p>
Using the <strong>Gastner–Newman cartogram method</strong>, the familiar world map is reshaped according to the concentration of mosques across countries. 
Territories expand, shrink, and stretch—not arbitrarily, but mathematically—reflecting the spatial weight of religious devotion embedded in the built environment.
</p>

<p>
Each distortion tells a story. Regions with dense networks of mosques swell beyond their geographic proportions, while others recede, challenging our intuitive sense of global scale. 
The red dots scattered across the map represent mosques, where <em>one dot equals 200 mosques</em>, turning abstract numbers into visible spatial patterns.
</p>

<p>
This map is not about comparison or hierarchy. It is a visual meditation—an attempt to see the world through a different metric, one rooted in faith, culture, and collective practice. 
By bending geography, the map invites viewers to reflect on how devotion, history, and demography quietly reshape the world we inhabit.

<p>
Created as a mandatory Eid creative work, this piece asks a simple but powerful question:
</p>

<p>
<strong>
If the world were drawn by the number of mosques, what would it look like?
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Eid becomes not just a moment of celebration here, but a lens—through which geography, belief, and cartography converge.
