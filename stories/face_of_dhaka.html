<h2> Hidden Face of Dhaka </h2>

<p>
While working with maps of Dhaka, I suddenly noticed something unexpected one day—the western edge of the city resembles a human face. The Turag and Buriganga rivers together shape this outline on the southwestern side of Dhaka. From the moment I saw it, I wanted to create a map focused on this particular form.

<p>
    I kept planning to do it, but it never quite happened. Today, however, while sitting through three lectures in a row and half-listening in that familiar academic haze, I finally broke the inertia and completed the map. I collected the river boundaries of the Buriganga and Turag, along with the city’s internal road network, from OpenStreetMap, and finished the work using QGIS.

<p>
    The face is oriented towards the southwest, with the forehead formed by the Turag River, the nose by the Buriganga, and the lips shaped by the road network. The eye is represented by a small waterbody near Mirpur Road, while the ear is depicted by a pond close to Shyamoli. The chin extends down to the area around Gabtoli.

    Dhaka is beautiful—but cartography makes it even more so.
