<h2>Dialects of Bangladesh</h2>

<p><strong>Story:</strong> 
Fifty-six thousand square miles—how big is that, really? Or two hundred million people—how many is that, actually? Nah, running from one end of the country to the other for all sorts of reasons, this question kept coming back to me. If you just go by the numbers or glance at that little jagged polygon slightly to the right of the Mercator map, it might seem like there can’t be much diversity in such a small space. But to truly see how colorful this land of six seasons and countless river streams flowing down from the Himalayas is, you have to walk along the narrow ridges between paddy fields, sit by the riverbanks, and listen to the songs of rural Bengal.
They say language changes every twenty kilometers. Linguists divide Bengali into multiple dialects alongside the standard form. That’s when it struck me—what if I made a map of regional languages? That’s where the trouble began. A Google search didn’t yield much. Dr. Mohammad Shahidullah’s Dictionary of Regional Languages of Bangladesh didn’t quite help either. So, with a page from Iarki Patrika and a few blog posts from Somewhereinblog as my only sources, I set out to do the work. But finding the spoken language of all sixty-four districts in one place? Nowhere to be found.

<p> So, I got my Facebook-star friend, Rasha Noel, to post a simple question: How do people in your area pronounce "আমাদের" (our)? Initially, I planned to include district names with each response, but in the midst of daily busyness, that didn’t happen. I can’t say I fully trust the data—there was no way to verify it. Still, after a bit of tweaking, I put together a map after office hours. If you find any mistakes in the pronunciations of your district, take it lightly and let me know the correction—I’ll fix it later. The languages of the hill districts are not Bengali, so I left those blank. I do plan to work on that separately in the future! </p>

   At the end of the day, International Mother Language Day is always about preserving linguistic diversity. Let this serve as another reminder of that cause, and let’s work to preserve the many regional languages of Bengal
