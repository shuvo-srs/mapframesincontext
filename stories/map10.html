<h2> Legofied Bangladesh </h2>

<p>At first glance, this looks like a toy world—bright blocks, simple forms, familiar colors. But look closer, and you’ll see that this is not a game board. It’s Bangladesh, rebuilt piece by piece.</p>

<p>This LEGO-inspired map reimagines the physiography of Bangladesh as a construction set: floodplains, terraces, foothills, deltas, and depressions snapped together like interlocking bricks. Each block represents a simplified landform, reducing complexity not to erase meaning, but to make it visible. The country becomes something you can almost assemble by hand—as if geography itself were modular.</p>

<p>Bangladesh is often described through water, and here that story is unavoidable. The vast delta dominates the south, gently sinking into the Bay of Bengal, while floodplains stretch across the heart of the country like a soft, flexible baseplate—designed to absorb, bend, and survive. The Barind and Madhupur tracts rise subtly, small but firm interruptions in an otherwise fluid landscape. To the east and northeast, the foothills hint at tectonic tension, where flatland slowly gives way to elevation.</p>

<p>The LEGO aesthetic does something important: it strips away false precision. Borders are generalized, forms are bold, and the map admits what all cartographers know but rarely say out loud—this is a model, not reality. Just like LEGO bricks, the pieces are standardized, but the stories they tell are not.</p>

<p>Inspired by modular design thinking, this map asks us to see Bangladesh not as a fragile accident of rivers, but as a carefully stacked system—one that has been rebuilt again and again by sediment, floods, people, and time.</p>

<p>Bangladesh, in this map, is not drowning.<br>
It is assembled.</p>
