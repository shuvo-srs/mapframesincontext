<h2> Rivers and Narayanganj </h2>

<p>
Even before the Mughal period, Khizirpur, Kadamrasul, and Madanganj functioned as major commercial zones and international river ports. After the defeat of Bengal’s last Nawab by the British forces at the Battle of Plassey, English traders began arriving in the region in large numbers, drawn by its commercial potential. At that time, the area gained global recognition for jute, salt, and a wide variety of spices and food products.

With the arrival of the East India Company, the importance of the western bank of the Shitalakshya River increased significantly. Due to the lack of direct connectivity between the capital Dhaka and the seaport of Chittagong, and because of the strong road and waterway links with what is now Narayanganj, Company officials prioritized the western bank of the Shitalakshya for establishing trading centers. One by one, low-lying wetlands were filled in to construct warehouses, residences, and commercial establishments.

During the Mughal administration, before the Company’s arrival, commercial revenue from this river port amounted to 6,447 taka, 10 annas, and 9 paisas. Under Company rule, by 1850, the port exported three crore yards of jute cloth to Europe and America. At that time, the price of one hundred jute cloth units was seven taka.

Individuals who supported the British during the Battle of Plassey were later rewarded by the colonial administration. As part of this process, in Bengali year 1173, Bhikhan Lal Thakur—also known as Lakshmi Narayan Thakur—received proprietary rights over this region through a formal deed from Company-appointed Nawab Muzaffar Jung (Muhammad Reza Khan). As the land was dedicated in the name of Lakshmi Narayan Thakur, the area formerly known as Khizirpur was renamed Narayanganj in the mid-eighteenth century.
