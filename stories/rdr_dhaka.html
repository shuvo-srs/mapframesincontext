<h2>Dacca in the 1920s</h2>

<p>The first game I installed on my new workstation last year was Red Dead Redemption 2. The game earned its praise for scale, storytelling, and character arcs—but what truly captured my attention was the map.</p>

<p>The in-game map is not merely a navigation aid for missions or treasure hunts; it is a work of art. It blends known locations with rumors and myths, hand-drawn illustrations of legendary animals, contour lines, and subtle cartographic flourishes. It reflects both the technical rigor and the cultural sensibility of early-1900s mapmaking. When you track a route, a hand-drawn red line appears—as if you marked the road yourself with a pen, exactly how people once did. That small detail stayed with me.</p>

<p>From that moment, I wanted to create a map inspired by this aesthetic.</p>

<p>Like many personal projects, it demanded more enthusiasm than discipline. I fully expected it to end up shelved with other unfinished ideas. Somehow, it didn’t. It survived.</p>

<p>The first real challenge was deciding what to map. I could have downloaded modern layers from OpenStreetMap and styled them accordingly—but that felt dishonest. Since RDR is set in the early 20th century, the map needed to belong to that era too. My initial goal was to find a map of Dhaka from around 1905–1910. I couldn’t. What I did find, however, was an original historical map embedded in a research paper on Dhaka’s urban growth.</p>

<p>That map stopped me.</p>

<p>It revealed a Dhaka shaped by water, rail, and open space—astonishingly green, and still unfolding under the late British Raj. This was the period when Dhaka received its first university and began emerging as an important center of the Indian subcontinent. The city felt lighter then, less burdened, more negotiable with its geography.</p>

<p>At first glance, familiar landmarks appear: Ramna Park, Azimpur Graveyard, Shahbagh (The real map is more detailed than this simplified recreation). But look closer and you begin to notice what no longer exists. The railway line shown here no longer follows this route; the station depicted is Fulbaria Old Railway Station, later relocated to Kamlapur, along with a realignment of the tracks. Dhaka New Market had not yet been established—Elephant Road directly connected Pilkhana to Hatirjheel, which itself lies outside the map’s frame. A vast green expanse known as Amla Para Playground has since vanished, replaced by academic institutions and dense residential blocks. Dholaikhal was not a drain, but part of a larger water system, with an extensive waterbody near present-day Motijheel—now lost.</p>

<p>Perhaps most striking is what Dhaka was not at the time.</p>

<p>It was not the capital of a country. It wasn’t even a provincial capital. That would come 23 years later—and then, another 23 years after that, it would become the capital of a new nation altogether. One can’t help but wonder: was Dhaka ever meant to carry this weight? Was it designed—geographically, socially, infrastructurally—to become what it is today? Will it endure and age like London or Paris?</p>

<p>Those answers won’t come from us.</p>

<p>They will come from another cartographer, a century from now, unfolding a map of their own time. Until then, we remain part of the story—both observers and contributors to history.</p>
