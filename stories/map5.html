<h2> Ghostbuster's Guide to Dhaka City </h2>

<p>
Last year, I had planned to make a map of eriee locations across Bangladesh, but it never quite came together.

"Historically, Bengal’s spirits seemed at ease dwelling in large trees and water. In the days of abandoned palaces, they roamed freely and dwelled in those, but as times changed and empty palaces turned into condomoniums and faded from memory, these spirits began to mingle with humans. Do ghosts and humans coexist in this way elsewhere in the world? Hard to say. But in Bengal, they have found their way into human life."
